This project is I would say my first ever project that I was proud of making. It started as a simple game of whack-a-mole but I decided to make much prettier than just a functioning
game. I put my web devloping skills to the test (mostly css) and made an interactable button with a mole that you can simply not touch (you can try hehe), and also made a few
changes-details that ended up helping the website look better a lot!
